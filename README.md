# 🍰 Bakery Management System

A containerized web-based application designed to streamline bakery inventory and order processing using a microservices architecture.

---

## 🧱 System Architecture

This solution consists of the following core services:

- PostgreSQL: Acts as the primary database, storing products, orders, and item details.
- Redis: Used as a cache layer for faster access to product and order information.
- RabbitMQ: Handles message queuing for asynchronous order processing.
- Flask Backend API: Provides REST endpoints for frontend communication and business logic.
- React Frontend: A responsive interface that allows users to view and order bakery items.
- Worker Service: A background service that listens to the RabbitMQ queue and processes orders.

## 🔄 Application Flow

1. Customers browse the product catalog through the frontend.
2. When an order is placed, the backend stores it in PostgreSQL and publishes a message to RabbitMQ.
3. The worker service picks up the message and processes the order in the background.
4. As processing continues, order status updates are reflected in the database.

 🛠️ Getting Started

 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

 Installation

1. Clone the project repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bakery-system
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the services:
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
   - RabbitMQ UI: [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672)  
     (Username: `guest`, Password: `guest`)

Stopping the App

To shut down all services:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

 Rebuilding After Changes

If you've made updates to the source code:
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

 📡 API Endpoints

 📦 Products

**GET** `/api/products`  
Fetch all available bakery products.

**Response**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Chocolate Cake",
    "description": "Rich chocolate layer cake with ganache",
    "price": 29.99,
    "image_url": "chocolate_cake.jpg"
  }
]
```

---

🧾 Orders

**POST** `/api/orders`  
Create a new customer order.

**Sample Request**:
```json
{
  "customer_name": "Vedanti Verma",
  "customer_email": "vedanti@example.com",
  "items": [
    {
      "product_id": 1,
      "quantity": 2,
      "price": 29.99
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "order_id": 123,
  "status": "pending",
  "queue_status": "sent to processing queue"
}
```

---

**GET** `/api/orders/{order_id}`  
View the status of an individual order.

**Sample Response**:
```json
{
  "order_id": 123,
  "customer_name": "Vedanti Verma",
  "status": "processing",
  "created_at": "2023-04-02 15:30:45",
  "items": [
    {
      "product_name": "Chocolate Cake",
      "quantity": 2,
      "unit_price": 29.99,
      "total": 59.98
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 🔍 Health Check

**GET** `/health`  
Verifies if the system services are running as expected.

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "services": {
    "database": "healthy",
    "rabbitmq": "healthy",
    "redis": "healthy"
  }
}
```

 🛠️ Design Decisions

🐳 Container Strategy

- Each component is containerized separately to promote modularity and scalability.
- Volumes are attached to PostgreSQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ to retain state across reboots.
- Health checks are defined for essential services to monitor uptime.

---

 🚀 Advanced Features

⚡ Redis Integration

- Speeds up product listing access using in-memory caching.
- Temporarily stores order data for quicker UI updates.
- Includes cache invalidation to maintain data consistency.

 🎯 Background Worker

- Orders are processed in the background through RabbitMQ.
- Includes retry logic for failed processing attempts.
- Updates order status automatically post-processing.

---

🔐 Security Aspects

- Uses environment variables to protect sensitive information.
- Containers run in isolated environments.
- Docker networks ensure controlled service communication.

---

📈 Future Enhancements

- User login and authentication features.
- Switch to HTTPS for secure communication.
- Set up real-time user notifications (email/SMS/webhooks).
- Add a monitoring stack (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
- CI/CD integration for auto-deployment and testing.
- Expand order handling to include delivery tracking.
